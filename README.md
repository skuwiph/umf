# Unified MetaForm

## To Do

The following is an incomplete list of changes which need to be made:

* Animations/Transitions

* Proper use of flex box for horizontal/vertical layout selection

* Refactor of controls to minimise duplicated functions

  * Possibly break the existing controls down a bit more for clarity in HTML

* Provide styling at a higher level if possible

* Refactor loading from JSON and converting to internal object model

  * Tests to compare JSON load to Fluently-created equivalent form

* Versioning between JSON versions and saved data

  * Require form-version to be added to the answer data?

* Read-only options

  * Entire form

  * Specific questions

  * Specific controls

* Optional help text

  * Data model

  * Look-up and display

  * Multi-Language

* Convert to library

  * npm/package manager

* Other languages
